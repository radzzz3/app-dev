**Overview**
#
Arcane is a stunningly animated series that explores the origins of iconic characters from League of Legends. Set in the twin cities of Piltover and Zaun, it delves into the conflict between these two vastly different societies: one thriving and rich, the other oppressed and deprived. The show intricately weaves tales of power, love, betrayal, and rebellion, all against a backdrop of magical technology known as Hextech.
